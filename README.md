This project displays the schedule for NCAA Women's Basketball games, it fetches data from an [Node API](https://github.com/lumamontes/wbb-games-api) and displays the game time, venue, location, and competitors for each game, with a mode toggle to change themes.

This is a simple project made with Next.js and Node, that i plan to expand with more features in the future (i created a few issues to keep track of them), with the intent to study and pratice more concepts with Next and Node like testing, web notifications, authentication, etc.
